   Welcome to the Magic 8-ball Project.  Complete the

   (you can just call them):

   // This will hide the '8' (if shown) and 
   // show the triangle (if hidden).  It will
   // set the text on the triangle to the
   // string 'answerText'.
   function makeAnswerAppear(answerText)

/* Write a function that handles the magic 8-ball being clicked. Here are the steps:

   - Create an array containing at least 5 possible answers as strings.
   - Generate a random array index by calling 
       getRandomIntInclusive function.
   - Call 'makeAnswerAppear' using the random
       answer you selected.
   - (Level-up) Prevent your code from selecting the 
       same answer multiple times in a row 
       (loops could be required).
